Don’t freak out ! This is not a bug, it is a feature. there are more then 50 decisions of equipment sale, but to avoid making you unnecessarily scroll through all of them, instead I decided to make them invisible until you have the amount of equipment needed to make the transaction, the amounts of equipment you will need are displayed in the "Explanation decisions" that are present in each category.§! \n\n§YYou can sell all types of equipment except Trains, tanks, planes, and ships. There are 4 "Batches" of equipment that you can sell with a single decision, and the number of liquid reserves it gives you was calculated as such:§! \n\n§Y42372 (roughly the prise  of 1 Production cost) X (production cost of the item) X (Amount)§! \n\n§YHowever, for every batch that is not the lowest amount, there will also be a 10% increase to the original price to give an incentive to save up equipment instead of selling it right away.§! \n\n§BAnd finally, a little note from the dev.\n\nThis mod is not really what i had in mind, i have plans for much greater changes, and an entirely different system of Arms trade, but this is what i can produce with my current knowlage of coding. If any person with good knowlage of TNO coding and/or art is interested in working with me, contact me through either Discord or reddit.§!\n\n\n§PAll rights reserved to JordenGG (u/JordenGG, JordenGG#6917) §!"
