#Opening
# (Old) market_explanation:0 "§RThese decisions are invisible unless the following conditions are met: is not an AI, has at least 1 military factory, and with the exception of Ireland, Zlatoust, and Norway, has at least 5B$ Of GDP§! \n\n§YHello there dear player, and welcome to the TNO: Market submod!§! \n\n§YThat's it, that's the whole submod, a single decision category, hey it ain't much but it's honest work.§! \n\n§YAnyway, this submod gives you the option to sell equipment, and lease stuff like Gird power, Production units, dockyards, etc for monthly revenue.§! \n\n§YNow, there is a very high chance that if you open the equipment decisions under this, they will be empty. Don’t freak out ! This is not a bug, it is a feature. there are more then 50 decisions of equipment sale, but to avoid making you unnecessarily scroll through all of them, instead I decided to make them invisible until you have the amount of equipment needed to make the transaction, the amounts of equipment you will need are displayed in the "Numbers" decisions that are present in each category.§! \n\n§YYou can sell all types of equipment except Trains, tanks, planes, and ships. There are 4 decisons of "Batches" of equipment that you can sell in a single decision, and the number of liquid reserves it gives you was calculated as such:§! \n\n§Y42372 (roughly the price of 1 Production cost) X (production cost of the item) X (Amount)§! \n\n§YHowever, for every batch that is not the lowest amount, there will also be a 10% increase to the original price to give an incentive to save up equipment instead of selling it right away.§! \n\n§BAnd finally, a little note from the dev.\n\nThis mod is what i was able to come up with my current coding abilities, i have plans for much greater changes, and an entirely different system of Arms trade, but this is what i could come up with using my current knowlage of coding. If any person with good knowlage of TNO coding and/or art is interested in working with me, contact me through either Discord or reddit.§!\n\n§PAll rights reserved to JordenGG (u/JordenGG, JordenGG#6917) §!"
